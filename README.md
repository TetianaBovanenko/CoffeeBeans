Using PyCharm I created a code for online coffee shop, which is able to greet a customer and give him to choose from available goods.The code takes customer's data and returns calculated values such as price, quantity and total price of the chosen items.

Functions and methods used: print(),input(),{dictionary},for...loop,if..., and a wee bit of math.
